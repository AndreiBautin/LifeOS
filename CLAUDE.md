# Working on Lift

A client-only React + TypeScript PWA for building strength programs and
tracking workouts. **No server, no database, no network calls.**
Persistence is IndexedDB behind a repository interface. That constraint is
the product, not a limitation — see
[docs/PERSISTENCE.md](docs/PERSISTENCE.md).

## Before you finish anything

```bash
pnpm verify    # typecheck + lint + format:check + test:run + build
```

A pre-push hook runs this and refuses the push if it fails. The same
command gates the deploy. If `pnpm verify` is green the change is
shippable; if it is not, it is not — there is no third state.

## The layer rule

Dependencies point **inward only**, enforced by ESLint
(`no-restricted-imports` in `eslint.config.js`), so breaking it fails the
build with a message explaining why.

```
features/  →  application/  →  domain/  ←  infrastructure/
```

| Layer               | May import         | Never imports                                     |
| ------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `domain/`           | nothing but itself | React, browser APIs, any library, any other layer |
| `application/`      | `domain/`          | `infrastructure/`, `features/`, React             |
| `infrastructure/`   | `domain/`          | `features/`, `app/`, React                        |
| `features/`, `app/` | anything           | —                                                 |

If a use-case needs something concrete — a repository, a clock, an id
generator — **take it as a parameter** and wire it in `src/app/di.ts`.
That file is the only place allowed to name a concrete implementation.

## Load-bearing invariants

These are each enforced by a lint rule or a test. They are listed here so
you know _why_ before you meet the error.

**The program is never the log.** A `ProgramTemplate` stores intent and a
`WorkoutLog` stores what happened. Never write a result back into a
template. All three predecessor apps collapsed these, and that single
decision is why editing a program corrupted history in every one of them.
Here it cannot happen at all: the template is derived rather than stored,
so there is nothing to write back into.

**Resolution is pure.** `domain/resolution/resolve.ts` turns a
prescription into a number with no I/O and no clock. Keep it that way; it
is where nearly all the tests live.

**Strength is RTS, and only RTS.** The three lifts are run by reps at an
RPE, with back-off work driven by measured fatigue percentages
(`domain/framework/rts.ts`). The overhead press is **not** a strength
lift — it was a main lift under 5/3/1 only because that framework wanted
a fourth one, and it contributes nothing to a total. It is hypertrophy
work in the 3–6 range.

5/3/1 was removed wholesale — framework, assembler, recipes, splits,
progression, `percent-training-max`, training maxes. It is in the git
history if it is ever wanted back. Do not reintroduce a second framework
without deciding to carry two of everything again.

**A suggested load is never the prescription.** `estimatedMaxes` (in
settings) is the basis for every suggestion, and an estimate is
acceptable _because_ RTS asks for reps at an RPE: get the number wrong
and the lifter corrects it by loading the bar they were going to load
anyway. This was the opposite under 5/3/1, where the percentage _was_
the prescription and an estimate would have silently changed what a cycle
meant — which is why training maxes existed and why they went with it.

**Assistance subtracts what the framework spent.** `domain/assembly/`
counts the volume the strength work already contributed before filling
anything. Removing that subtraction turns one coherent program into a
powerlifting block with a bodybuilding routine stapled to it.

**Frequency comes from the volume, not from a floor.**
`domain/volume/frequency.ts`. A muscle owed twenty-two sets a week cannot
take them in two sittings; one owed four can. `requiredFrequency` divides
the weekly target by a per-session ceiling and the assembler backfills
against that. The flat floor it replaced was satisfied by _any_
contribution, including the half-credit a row pays the biceps — so the
upper back read as trained five days a week off one barbell row while
being trained directly once. **Frequency counts direct work only**
(`trainedDirectly`); half credit is right for volume and wrong here.

**Frequency is a means to volume, never a goal.** The backfill will not
schedule a muscle already at its weekly target, secondary credit
included. Without that guard the two-session floor applied to the front
delts — asking for three sets while the bench press and dips paid them
ten — and put an overhead press on every Friday to satisfy an arithmetic
minimum for a muscle at three times its target. The backfill also orders
by deficit, not by the order muscles happen to appear in `RpDay.muscles`;
that array is grouped by region, and walking it verbatim left the side
delts last in `UPPER` and finishing blocks ten sets short.

**A day under `SESSION_TOO_SHORT_MINUTES` may take work it does not
need.** The one place at-target muscles are still scheduled, and the
rationale is attendance rather than stimulus: a squat day whose legs are
all on maintenance otherwise comes out at twenty-five minutes. Two sets
past target on a maintained muscle beats a trip nobody makes. Do not
widen this into general padding — padding days that were _already full
enough_ is the behaviour the guard above exists to refuse.

**A day owns its muscles or it does not.** `RpDay.muscles`, one list, one
fill pass. The five-day week is lopsided by construction — with the legs
on maintenance they ask for about twenty-three sets across two sessions
while a specialised upper body asks for a hundred across three — and
there have now been two wrong answers to that.

Listing the arms on every day was the first: a deadlift day was as
entitled to a curl as Monday was, so heavy pulls were followed by upright
rows. A lower-priority `overflowMuscles` list filled after the day's own
work was the second: better ordering, same output, and it produced
sessions nobody would write.

The resolution is in the split, not the assembler. **The deadlift day is
a pull day** — `PULL` in `rp-splits.ts` puts the lats and upper back on
it as ordinary accountability, because rowing and chinning after
deadlifts is a session somebody would actually write. Tuesday stays legs
and core and comes in around forty minutes, which is not a day that went
wrong; it is a maintained lower body carrying a heavy squat. What still
does not fit is reported on the Plan screen rather than tucked into
whichever session had a gap.

**A muscle's target depends on its own tier and nothing else.**
`priorityPosition` maps rank onto a position between
`BOTTOM_TIER_POSITION` and `TOP_TIER_POSITION` and stops there. There
used to be a `spreadFactor` scaling the whole mapping by how crowded the
top tier was — sound reasoning ("prioritising everything prioritises
nothing"), catastrophic as an implementation. Every target depended on
every other muscle's placement, so moving the biceps out of tier 1
silently raised the side delts from 22 to 24 and pushed them past what
the week could deliver. A lifter could not state a mental map without the
app renegotiating it. **Do not reintroduce a cross-muscle term here.**

**"You cannot prioritise everything" is a capacity report, not a
multiplier.** It lives on the Plan screen: the tiers state the ask, and
the page lists any muscle the hardest week of the built program leaves
short. Measured off the assembler's output rather than modelled, so it
cannot drift from what the program does — and **counted per muscle, never
in aggregate**, because every set pays two or three muscles and the
delivered total therefore exceeds the asked total even when individual
muscles are starved.

**A jump is the only non-training way to move the position.**
`jumpToWeek`. Everything else advances by finishing or skipping, which
is right — the position records what happened. But a lifter arriving
mid-block would otherwise skip fifteen sessions to line the app up.

**Landmarks stay ordered.** `MV ≤ MEV ≤ MAV ≤ MRV`, always. Check-ins
move MAV only, within bounds, and only with three sessions of evidence.
MEV never moves from a soreness rating.

**Readiness scales today, not the landmarks.** Sleep and stress adjust
one session. They must never produce a landmark proposal.

**The program is derived, never stored.** `deriveProgram(settings,
library)` in `application/use-cases/programs/current-program.ts`. Only the
_position_ persists. Storing the program produced the same bug four times
— a change reaching the code and not the copy on the device — and each
fix patched one delivery route while leaving the others open: additive
sync, then content refresh, then retirement, then re-snapshotting. All of
it is gone. There is no library, no built-in program, no instance, no
frozen snapshot, and nothing to press to pick up a change.

**Derivation must be deterministic.** Same settings in, byte-identical
program out, slot ids included. A workout in progress refers to its day
by position and its sets by index; a program that differed between reads
would make every one of those a guess. That is why assembly takes an id
generator as a parameter — `current-program.ts` passes a counter, not
`crypto.randomUUID`.

**A log describes itself.** A `WorkoutLog` embeds the prescription,
planned load and planned reps of every set. That is what made the frozen
snapshot unnecessary: history never needed the template to interpret it.
Do not "normalise" this by referencing a program instead.

**A position is clamped, not reset.** The program can get shorter under a
lifter — five days a week to three. `clampPosition` pulls them back
inside it. Resetting to week one instead would cost them a block.

**Skipping, abandoning and finishing are three different things.**
Finishing advances the program and files a log. Skipping advances it and
writes _nothing_ — a day trained elsewhere did not happen here.
Abandoning does not advance it at all: with nothing logged the record is
deleted, and with sets logged it is kept as `abandoned`. Every one of the
alternatives puts an empty workout in the history, where it counts as a
training day and drags every frequency and volume figure down. Finishing
and skipping share `nextPosition` so they cannot drift.

**Choosing is not ordering.** The fill picks exercises by which muscle
is owed the most, which is right for deciding _what_ is in a session and
wrong for deciding _when_. `inSessionOrder` is a separate pass:
warm-ups, the competition lift, compounds heaviest-first, isolation,
conditioning. Without it a day opened with a maximal deadlift, went to a
calf raise, and came back to a squat.

**Names are derived, never written.** `describeDay` reads a day's `label`
and `focus` off its finished slots; `describeBlock` reads the block's name
and description off the tiers. A hardcoded "Monday — press and pull" is a
claim that goes stale the moment a tier moves. The `focus` line separates
direct work from what the day only pays incidentally, ranked by share of
each muscle's weekly target — merging the two named an upper day after
the core, because pull-ups pay it a fraction and its target is small
enough for that fraction to win. The _kind_ of work — strength,
hypertrophy, conditioning — is the heading; the muscles are the sentence
under it. **Every muscle with direct work is named**, uncapped: a reader
who can see a curl in the session and no biceps in the description has
found a bug whatever the arithmetic said.

**Every slot has a category and a sub-category.** Strength splits into
`Top set` and `Back-off`, hypertrophy into `Compound` and `Isolation`,
warm-ups into `Upper` and `Lower`, conditioning into its intensity
domain — `Zone 2` or `HIIT`. **Two conditioning domains, not three**:
LISS and Zone 2 are the same work under two names, so the incline walk
and the easy run share a label. What separates those two is systemic
cost, which the exercise already carries. The sub-category lives on
`Slot.variant` and is copied onto `LogEntry.variant` at start, not
derived from the role — a warm-up's body half and a strength slot's
position in the pair cannot be read off `role` at all. The roles stay
`hypertrophy` and `assistance` because they are written into every stored
log, but both _label_ as "Hypertrophy".

**The competition lift is two slots, not one.** They were merged once on
the reasoning that it is one exercise in one trip to the rack — true, and
it hid what makes this RTS: the top set is a _measurement_ everything
below derives from, and the back-off count is discovered rather than
planned. As one six-set row it read exactly like a percentage
prescription. They stay adjacent because `inSessionOrder` is a stable
sort and both rank the same. **`previousSetFor` must take the variant**:
matching on the exercise alone hands the first back-off the previous
session's _top set_ as its "last time".

**A heavy hypertrophy set is not taken to failure.** `safeToFail` covers
"you would be pinned under it"; `HEAVY_HYPERTROPHY_REPS` covers the other
case — failing a top-heavy triple costs what a max costs. The overhead
press carried both the note "one rep in reserve, not a max" and a last
set at RPE 10.

**A low-rep set is worth less than a full one.** `hypertrophyCredit` in
`domain/volume/accounting.ts` — linear below five reps, capped above.
Counting a top-set single as one hard set let the three competition lifts
overshoot a maintained muscle's weekly target on their own, which is
arithmetically true and physiologically misleading. Changing it changes
how much accessory work the assembler thinks the legs still need.

**A repeat is penalised across the week, not just against yesterday.**
The same upright row kept appearing on Tuesday and Thursday. It is a soft
sort, never a filter: side delts have two hypertrophy options and calves
have one, so banning a repeat would drop the muscle from the day instead.

**A timed set is costed by its duration.** `setSeconds` in
`domain/programs/program.ts`. Counting a twenty-minute walk as one
thirty-second set made conditioning free to the planner, which then
stacked a run onto the longest day of the week and still believed it fit.

**Exclusions are absolute.** A lifter who cannot do an exercise means it
everywhere — warm-ups and conditioning included, not only the hypertrophy
picker.

**No day is pinned to an exercise.** `RpDay` used to carry `anchors`, a
list of slugs a day was built around: Monday to an overhead press,
pull-ups, lateral raises and curls, Friday to dips and rows. It existed
to make a generated block continue the session a lifter had actually
trained, which was worth having while history was being imported.

It is gone, and the reason it had to go is the reason everything else
here is derived: an anchor is a transcript, not a derivation. The pinned
exercises went on being scheduled after the tiers that justified them had
moved, and an overhead press outlived the front delts falling to
maintenance. **Do not reintroduce a slug list on a day.** If a movement
pattern is worth guaranteeing, guarantee the _pattern_ and let the picker
choose — and know that a muscle whose target is zero will receive no
direct work at all, which is the model behaving correctly.

**`pending` is a real set outcome.** A set that has not been performed is
not a completed set with no numbers in it. Volume accounting depends on
the distinction.

**The exercise library is derived too.** `resolveLibrary` in
`domain/exercises/library.ts`, called from the exercise repository. The
catalogue is read at every use; the store holds only a lifter's own
exercises and _retired built-ins_, which come back archived so old logs
still resolve. This replaced three delivery mechanisms — seed on first
run, additive sync, hand-written retirement list — which between them
still could not deliver an edit to an exercise that already existed. A
device went on showing "Pull-Ups" and a 12–20 lateral raise long after
the catalogue said otherwise. **Editing the catalogue is now the whole
delivery.** Do not reintroduce a store-of-record for shipped content.

**No `console` outside the logger.** No `localStorage` outside
`infrastructure/storage/`. No `indexedDB` outside `infrastructure/db/`.
No bare `new Date()` — take a `Clock`. Each is a lint rule with a
message.

## Where new code goes

A feature is usually a slice through the layers, inner first:

1. **`domain/`** — the rule, as a pure function, with `x.test.ts` beside it.
2. **`application/use-cases/<area>/`** — takes dependencies as a
   parameter. Load → apply the rule → save.
3. **`app/di.ts`** — register it on `AppServices` if it needs a new port.
4. **`features/<area>/hooks.ts`** — a TanStack Query hook resolving
   services from `useServices()`.
5. **`features/<area>/`** — the component.

## Traps

**Adding a load or rep variant** means adding to the union in
`domain/programs/prescription.ts`. `switch-exhaustiveness-check` will
then fail the build at every consumer until each is handled. That is
working as intended — silently falling through to a default is how a
prescription becomes a wrong number.

**Never edit an existing IndexedDB migration step.** Bump `DB_VERSION`
and add a new guarded block. A device that already ran a step will not
run it again, so editing one leaves two devices with different schemas
and no way to tell.

**Exercise ids are slugs, not UUIDs** (`bench-press`). They are stable
across devices and readable in an export file. Do not "fix" this.

**Icons are generated**, not hand-placed: `node scripts/generate-icons.mjs`.
CI fails if `public/icons` and the script disagree.

**The rest timer derives from an absolute timestamp.** Do not rewrite it
as a countdown; a locked phone suspends the tab and the timer would
under-report.

## Mobile UX bar

Used one-handed, in a gym, with chalky hands, between sets.

- Every control clears 44px (`.tap-target`).
- Numeric inputs use `inputMode="decimal"` and no spinners.
- Nothing important sits at the top of the screen; navigation is at the
  bottom, where a thumb reaches.
- A set is logged in one tap plus two prefilled numbers.
